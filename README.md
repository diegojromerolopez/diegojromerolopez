### Hello visitor!

My name is Diego J. and I'm a software engineer from Spain, currently based on Madrid.

- English is not my native language, but I'd say I can make me understand in it (but please, excuse me for the mistakes I could make while using it).
- I don't have a favorite programming language, but I like working with Python.
- I accept suggestions, issues, feature requests, crazy ideas and even a good conversation about my projects. I love feedback!
- You can reach me at my email: diegojromerolopez@gmail.com or sending me a meesage to [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegojromerolopez/).
- [I have a technical blog](https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/).
- I like to create projects in github that help people. Nothing really big like compilers, databases or operative systems, but useful stuff nonetheless. Take a look at some of them:
  - [Gelidum](https://github.com/diegojromerolopez/gelidum)
  - [Django-Async-Include](https://github.com/diegojromerolopez/django-async-include)
  - [Django-WS-Include](https://github.com/diegojromerolopez/django-ws-include)  
  - [DJBDD](https://github.com/diegojromerolopez/djbdd)
- If like any of [my projects](https://github.com/diegojromerolopez?tab=repositories) and would like to make me a donation [use my paypal.me page](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/diegojromerolopez) (if you don't want to use paypal, contact me!)
